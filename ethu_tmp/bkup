Our titles have received multiple prestigeous awards throughout the years including: Apple Design Award, Best of PAX and IGN Editor's Choice. \n \n- \n \nIt all started in 2009, when a bunch of veterans of polish gaming industry joined their forces and founded 11 bit studios. They gathered few talented people and got to work. After a year our first child was born – Anomaly Warzone Earth hit the stores. Quickly it became a huge success, with great sales and number of industry awards, including Apple Design Award. \n \nIt was a proof that we were on the right track and in the next few years we repeated the success with Anomaly 2, Anomaly Korea and few other games. But you know what they say – the more you have, the more you want so in 2012 we decided it was time for something bigger. \n \nFor the next two years we worked on our upcoming title. Bigger and better than ever before, but what’s even more important – a game that had a potential to touch people. A game that could matter. Something, that hasn’t been done before. A thing to be played and discussed for years to come. In the end of 2014 we were ready and our greatest achievement to this day had it’s premiere. On 14th of November This War of Mine had its release and everything had changed. \n \nThe cost of development were covered in first weekend after the premiere, and since then the game keeps being one of the topsellers on Steam and other distribution platforms. The game got over 100 awards and was covered as a phenomenon in the biggest magazines and newspapers all around the world including TIME, EDGE, Washington Post and more. \n \nThis brings us to the place where we are today. This War of Mine is still selling really well, being one of the most successful indie titles of the last decade. Our next big game, Frostpunk, is right around the corner and you know what? Again our guts are telling us it will leave a mark. We are crossing the borders and redefining the rules of the genre and that’s the road we want to follow. We believe in creating things instead of just copying them. \n \nSoon you’ll tell us if we achieved what we hoped for. In the meantime we are not slacking around – we started a publishing program that allows developers from all around the world to release their indie games with our help. The first games are already out there, so you should check them out. \n \nThat’s our story so far, but we are quite sure there is more to come. \n \n~ 11 bit studios	\N	1191715200	0	\N	2019-08-21 03:24:25.502731	2019-08-21 03:24:25.502731

317	2262	NIS America	Nippon Ichi Software was founded in September 1991 in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, as an entertainment software company. It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's "Stateside Publisher of the Year Award" in 2009.	\N	1072224000	0	\N	2019-09-01 09:15:27.434497	2019-09-01 09:15:27.434497

Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience. \n \nIn 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One.

591	805128	Article by Thomas Morgan, Senior Staff Writer, Digital Foundry	How apt that in the week that Eurogamer itself celebrates its 20th birthday, a remaster should appear for one of 1999's finest console releases. With Final Fantasy 8 Remastered, the hope is to get the definitive edition for PS4, Xbox One, PC and Switch. Two decades on from its original launch, it's conspicuous in being the last FF of that era to get any form of HD treatment - and when you see the remaster in action, it's clear why. As much as this new version takes steps in the right direction, there are points which are - sadly - a step back from the PlayStation original.It's a shame because Final Fantasy 8 was a landmark release, taking the technological triumphs of FF7 and significantly building upon them. The beautiful video sequences returned, for example, but this time pre-rendered scenes integrated more closely with what was then state-of-the-art 3D modeling. It's an idea that FF7 toyed with at points, but it's used far more extensively in its sequel to give a suitably cinematic presentation. The Dorrit mission for example, was used to demo the game ahead of release - an incredible set piece involving a mech crab chasing Squall through the streets. It meant we got visuals far beyond what PS1 hardware could ever realistically achieve in real time - by virtue of sheer brute force, filling four CDs with pre-rendered video sequences. This combination of FMV and real-time 3D was an incredible feat of technology for its day, but Squaresoft pushed out the boat in many other ways, too. The score used higher quality sampling on PS1, with a focus on recorded vocal tracks. The engine also ran with higher-polygon character models for the main cast - meaning that Squall, Rinoa and Seifer appear in battle with the same model as the game's traversal segments. Also, the large, intruding battle window of FF7 - which took up a good chunk of the screen's lower half - is removed. Instead the entire frame shows the 3D action, overlayed with a transparent HUD for HP. Going from one to the other in the late 90s, it's a huge improvement.

449	750714	Sarah James	Borderlands 2 has seen a huge increase in concurrent players on Steam in the last week, no doubt a result of escalating interest in the series following the reveal of Borderlands 3.The game peaked just shy of 60K players last weekend—59,033 according to Steam Charts (highlighted here on GitHype). The review scores remain Very Positive on both Borderlands 2 and the original game, though closer inspection will show that both games have seen recent 'off-topic review activity'—read more about those review bombing efforts here.  Borderlands 2 has remained a firm favourite with PC players since its release back in 2012. So it seems that news of Borderlands 3, along with a pretty hefty Steam bundle that currently has a 74 percent discount attached to it, seems to have persuaded fans to return to the second game. If you're wondering what all the fuss is about, you can check out why Jody thought Borderlands 2 was ahead of its time. Alternatively, you can read up on everything we know about Borderlands 3, which is set for release on September 13.	https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JqsDKr8junBxdeHtaj8QNH-1200-80.jpg	2019-09-01 08:03:34.535834	Borderlands 2 peaked at almost 60,000 players on Steam last weekend	http://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-2-peaked-at-almost-60000-players-on-steam-last-weekend	PC Gamer	2019-09-01 08:03:34.555927	1555027200	104

427	744041	Samuel Horti	The creators of ElDewrito, the Halo Online mod that was blocked last year, have claimed they hastened Microsoft's decision to bring Halo: The Master Chief Collection to PC.In a blog post this week one of the mod team, posting as RabidSquabbit, detailed conversations they had with Halo developer 343 Industries immediately following Microsoft's DMCA takedowns. "After the success of our 0.6 release, where we had 12,000 concurrent players, they were professional, impressed, congratulatory, and even sympathetic and apologetic about the unfortunate circumstances surrounding Microsoft issuing DMCA takedowns against Halo Online and Twitch Streamers," RabidSquabbit said.They claim the success also prompted 343 Industries to bring forward their plans for The Master Chief Collection on PC. The collection has "always been planned to be eventually on PC", but the ElDewrito team is the reason it is happening "right now", RabidSquabbit said. "They mentioned to us that our success with ElDewrito lit a spark and we were told it 'gave us a kick in the pants'."The mod team has been acting as an "advisory board" to 343 ahead of the collection's release, and will help 343 explore options for official mod support.Finally, RabidSquabbit said that the ElDewrito mod "is not dead"—people are still playing it—and the team "is not going anywhere...you’ll be seeing a hell of a lot more from us in the future, whether it be in the existing ElDewrito mod, or MCC PC itself," they said. Thanks, PCGamesN.	https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rNz7mJ6jUNPUeyL27UVrmB-1200-80.jpg	2019-08-29 07:56:48.384408	Halo ElDewrito modders gave Microsoft 'a kick in the pants' over Master Chief Collection	http://www.pcgamer.com/halo-eldewrito-modders-gave-microsoft-a-kick-in-the-pants-over-master-chief-collection	PC Gamer	2019-08-29 07:56:48.413101	1553299200	93

Specifically, lots and lots of pizza. Too much pizza, if there is such a thing.Last week, Reddit user thewombinthesky promised to buy a pizza for any 343 employee commenting, but only if the collection got announced during the Inside Xbox show. Which it was. But others clearly followed suit, turning the studio's office into a temporary pizza dimension. 	https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RWUiMDnXX8fscKCMb7BjgQ-1200-80.jpg	2019-08-29 07:56:48.397991	Halo: The Master Chief Collection devs were sent far too much pizza by fans	http://www.pcgamer.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-devs-were-sent-far-too-much-pizza-by-fans	PC Gamer	2019-08-29 07:56:48.416751	1552435200	93

Developer The Game Kitchen's gorgeously grotesque "non-linear" action-platformer Blasphemous, will be heading to Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, and Switch later this year, publisher Team 17 has announced.If the name sounds familiar, that's because The Game Kitchen (previously responsible for The Last Door, a wonderfully atmospheric series of Lovecraft-inspired point-and-click adventures), initially unveiled Blasphemous all the way back in the shadowy depths of 2017.At the time, it was cavorting its wares on Kickstarter, with the campaign eventually securing an impressive $333,246 USD - well above its original $50,000 USD goal. Truthfully though, it's not hard to see why so many people were drawn to the project: it's an extremely attractive game.

320	313129	Thomas Faust	The Bergson family has been guarding the mystical Mount Morta for generations. When corruption turns the once peaceful mountain into a violent, monster-infested nightmare, they face their biggest challenge yet. What these monsters don't know: they're messing with the wrong family. Children of Morta's core gameplay loop consists of action-filled dungeon dives. See how far you come and then spend the resources you brought back on updates for your characters or your house. Get a little further next time, unlock some new stuff, rinse and repeat. This formula feels familiar by now and is competently done, but that's not what makes this game special, anyhow. You see, there are these short vignettes of family life interspersed into the hacky and slashy parts. Grandma telling stories by the fireplace, the wife feeding the wildlife in the nearby forest (or panicking about a mouse in the kitchen), the kids playing or taking care of an orphaned puppy their father picked up in the dungeon. These short cutscenes don't add anything substantial to the main story, but they infuse the whole game with a sense of serenity and peace that's much-needed in the face of impending doom and constant peril. They give you something worth coming home to. Ultimately, Children of Morta doesn't really depict how families work, but how they should work: as harmonious communities sharing love, warmth, and an overwhelming desire not to take shit from some world-ending monster apocalypse. And that's something to aspire to. Children of Morta will be out later this year.	http://indiegames.com/assets_c/2018/02/morta1-thumb-480x274-25773.jpg	2019-08-22 09:15:19.02305	Children Of Morta Is All About Family	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IndependentGaming/~3/bppZRqkHD1w/children_of_morta.html	google	2019-09-04 07:12:38.557986	1518998400	120
531	258802	\N	Children of Morta, a "narrative-driven hack-and-slash roguelike" about the Bergson family, was announced in 2014 and then successfully Kickstarted in 2015. And today, developer Dead Mage announced that it should be ready for release sometime in the first half of 2018, and more importantly put out a new gameplay trailer revealing the progress that's been made over the past couple of years. The pixel art graphics looks fantastic, but it's the promise of "a powerful narrative of familial ties" about a family that's guarded Mount Morta for generations that really grabs my attention. Six different family members will be available for the fight, each with their own unique playstyles, personalities, and quests, while the world of Morta itself will be filled with its own mysteries and lore to uncover. "Experience what it means to be in a family of heroes.

532	777405	\N	Children of Morta was announced in 2014 as a roguelike action game about the Bergsons, an extended family that's served as the guardians of the mystical Mount Morta for generations. It was expected to release in 2018 but at the last minute, developer Dead Mage Studio delayed it into 2019. With launch now just a few months away, the studio has released a (very) time-limited demo that covers the first chapter of the story and two playable members of the family: John, the father, and his eldest daughter Linda.   I had some issues getting the demo to run, including one crash-to-desktop, but after a reboot it fired up and ran without trouble. More importantly, it was very impressive. I only spent about 20 minutes with it, enough time to run through the tutorial and get a taste of the Bergson's weird world, but I really liked what I saw. Gameplay is very similar to Diablo, with primary and secondary attacks, dodging, and defensive maneuvers, and while each family member appears to be the equivalent of a character class—John is a sword-swinging fighter, Linda is a rogue with a bow—each of them can be customized through skill trees and whole-family upgrades.  body .hawk-widget{--trd-blue:#2f6e91;width:100%;letter-spacing:normal;}._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{margin:16px 0;}@media (min-width:600px){._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{margin:0;min-height:128px;float:right;clear:none;width:50%;}.fancy_box_body ._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{float:none;width:100%;}}.icon~.hawk-widget{clear:both;}.featured_product_block .hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price] .hawk-price-subscriptions-deal-classic-container{-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-align:end;align-items:flex-end;}.featured_product_block .hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price] .hawk-price-subscriptions-deal-classic-container .hawk-promo-price-widget-deal{margin:0;}@media (min-width:400px){body .buyingguide .product .hawk-widget.bg-price{float:right;width:40%;}}The mechanical part of the game (what I've seen of it, anyway) is fairly conventional: It's everything else that promise to make Children of Morta stand out. The pixel-art graphics are spectacular, the music and narration are spot-on, and even though the Bergson's home feels downright cozy, there's an ominous edge to it all that reminds me of those old-time fairy tales where terrible things happen to small children. I didn't find any of the random dungeon events Wes and Austin talked about last year, but I'm eager to dive back in and go digging for them.For reasons I don't fully (or even slightly) understand, the demo will only be available until June 22, which is a shame because it's really good. If you've had any interest at all in Children of Morta, I'd strongly urge you to grab it from Steam and give it a run while you can. And if you miss out, the good news is that, barring further delays, the full release isn't too terribly far away: The Children of Morta...	https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FcJdZotYD9jSys4XAghRBX-1200-80.jpg	2019-09-04 07:12:38.536104	Children of Morta gets a time-limited demo on Steam, and it's really good	http://www.pcgamer.com/children-of-morta-gets-a-time-limited-demo-on-steam-and-its-really-good	PC Gamer	2019-09-04 07:12:38.563251	1561075200	120

537	305833	Joe Donnelly	As if mid-January Mondays weren't difficult enough, I'm about to make you feel old. Resident Evil 2 celebrated its 20th anniversary yesterday, debuting on PlayStation consoles in the US on January 21, 1998. And while Leon and Claire and the trench coat-donning Mr X wouldn't arrive on PC for another year after that, I hardly feel comforted by the fact it's been 19 years since we first fumbled around the RCPD headquarters on Windows 95-powered desktops. What is more reassuring, though, is original sequel director Hideki Kamiya's faith in the upcoming and much-anticipated remake. When asked via Twitter if he felt the team in charge of the RE2 remake would do the first game justice, Kamiya spoke positively about a conversation he had with the new game's director last year. "I went drinking with him last year and told him 'Do as you like'," says Kamiya. "That's the way directors should do. I trust him and his team.&amp;quo	http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZLXE2bCnw3H8VXekombFt9-1200-80.jpg	2019-09-04 07:29:53.461177	Resident Evil 2 director trusts remake team, says 'do as you like'	http://www.pcgamer.com/resident-evil-2-director-trusts-remake-team-says-do-as-you-like	PC Gamer	2019-09-04 07:29:53.477335	1516579200	123

The trailer shown was unusually character-focused and combat-light—and while it's understood the game will be built from the ground up on PC, we didn't see much of it in motion on stage. In conversation with Wired, Fergusson says Gears of War 5 targets 60 fps and 4K as standard on consoles, but can scale up to 120 fps on PC. "Our target is always 60fps, and we believe—with everything we've done, the learning we've taken from Gears 4, and the optimisations we've been able to do beyond that—that's exactly what we're going to be doing, 60fps at 4K," says Fergusson while discussing the game's Xbox One X variation. "Having a game that we're building from the ground up for PC [means players] will be able to take advantage of all the types of different PC optimisation options you can have."Like	https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tptW6H3nKHJcGmwip7pyPH-1200-80.jpg	2019-09-15 11:54:17.315003	Gears of War 5 'built from the ground up for PC'	http://www.pcgamer.com/gears-of-war-5-built-from-the-ground-up-for-pc	PC Gamer	2019-09-15 11:54:17.342861	1529539200	139

457	772259	Tyler Wilde	At The PC Gaming Show today, show sponsor Perfect World showed off a new trailer for Remnant: From the Ashes, a third-person survival shooter from Gunfire Games.Basically, the world is screwed—the apocalypse happened, as it is wont to do in games—and everything is overrun by monsters. It's up to you and up to two co-op partners to wipe them out.The devs are clearly going for a Souls feel, with giant, grotesque bosses that lay down big attacks for players to dodge. While Remnant can be played solo, Gunfire recommends playing co-op to "increase your chances of survival." Fair enough. In the trailer above, one enemy easily grabs a player with horrible hook hands and raises them like an animal to be slaughtered. Having friends to help is probably a good idea.At the show, Gunfire games CEO David Adams talked a bit about the procedural generation in Remnant. "One of the coolest features of the game is the dynamic generation system," said Adams. "We generate the map, the enemies, the quests, the NPCs, bosses, everything."It's all hand scripted but the system takes all the pieces and stitches them together."Remnant: From the Ashes will release on August 20, and Adams announced at the PC Gaming Show today that those who pre-order will get early, "VIP" access on August 16. You can learn more on the official site.	https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6YNW9KufbxuwDf7p7AMpJ-1200-80.jpg	2019-09-01 08:40:41.181126	Remnant: From the Ashes gets a new story trailer, 'VIP' access for pre-orders	http://www.pcgamer.com/remnant-from-the-ashes-trailer-pc-gaming-show	PC Gamer	2019-09-05 10:13:10.547514	1560124800	133
560	776834	\N	Remnant: From the Ashes, Gunfires Games' cooperative survival shooter, is set in a devastated world full of radiation and monstrous beasties, and in a new trailer we get a closer look at the aggressively unpleasant wasteland players will fight their way through in a couple of months."From the lonely desert dunes, to the dark canyon crevices, Rhom contains echoes of a once great civilisation," reads the trailer synopsis. "Whatever hospitality there once was in these cities has been reduced to a steel graveyard of the twisted and hollowed buildings, full of dangerous beings not of our world, but have gained an appreciation for the taste of our flesh." body .hawk-widget{--trd-blue:#2f6e91;width:100%;letter-spacing:normal;}._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{margin:16px 0;}@media (min-width:600px){._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{margin:0;min-height:128px;float:right;clear:none;width:50%;}.fancy_box_body ._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{float:none;width:100%;}}.icon~.hawk-widget{clear:both;}.featured_product_block .hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price] .hawk-price-subscriptions-deal-classic-container{-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-align:end;align-items:flex-end;}.featured_product_block .hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price] .hawk-price-subscriptions-deal-classic-container .hawk-promo-price-widget-deal{margin:0;}@media (min-width:400px){body .buyingguide .product .hawk-widget.bg-price{float:right;width:40%;}}Last week we got to see another trailer, revealing at the PC Gaming Show.

12	19561	Days Gone	Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game set in a harsh wilderness two years after a devastating global pandemic. Play as Deacon St. John, a Drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. \n \nAt its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love – and hope. It’s about how even when confronted with such enormous tragedy they find a reason to live. Hope never dies.	Set in the beautiful, volcanic scarred high-desert of the Pacific Northwest, Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game where you play as Deacon St. John, a Drifter and bounty hunter who would rather risk the dangers of the broken road than live in one of the “safe” wilderness encampments. The game takes place two years after a global pandemic has killed almost everyone, but transformed millions of others into what survivors call Freakers – mindless, feral creatures, more animal than human but very much alive and quickly evolving. In the demo you saw two types of Freaks – Newts, which were adolescents when infected, are opportunistic hunters, preferring to hit and run from the shadows; and a Horde. Made up of hundreds of individual Freakers, Hordes eat, move and attack together, almost as one. Some Hordes roam the highways at night, while others, like the one in the demo, have found a food source that keeps it in a single location. Skills learned in his prior life as an outlaw biker have given Deacon a slight edge in the seemingly never-ending fight to stay alive. But will it be enough?	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1izz.jpg	\N	\N	2019-04-26	2019-08-07 07:14:19.459472	2019-08-07 07:14:19.459472	96.1462456560362	days-gone	\N

165	549	God of War	Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as "Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).	Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23] \n \nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, "Ghost of Sparta". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1hud.jpg	\N	\N	2005-03-22	2019-08-14 10:40:16.759662	2019-08-14 10:40:17.512747	9.20769236954896	god-of-war-7013212e-9aa1-4b77-8982-f7c17dc4d432	6

130	1011	Borderlands 2	Five years after the events of Borderlands, a valuable mineral called "Eridium" starts flourishing through Pandora's crust. Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and uses it to rule over Pandora with an iron fist. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it.	The opening cutscene introduces the four new Vault Hunters as they ride a train on Pandora. However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP ("Claptrap") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort. \nUpon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary. \nRoland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky. \nJack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary. \nMordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath. \nBrick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that "there ain't no rest for the wicked" before the screen fades to black.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1mx4.jpg	\N	\N	2012-09-18	2019-08-13 15:56:59.843453	2019-08-13 15:57:02.39757	24.6483107357191	borderlands-2	4

And may Fiure keep me hidden from the harm, like a Crow soaring to the night sky.” \n \nNorvalgians are people dedicated to searching for the truth and serving their gods. Both of these ideals are combined in their oldest tradition: debating. Whenever a decision needs to be made – whether it is about heading to war or choosing where the cheese should go in a sandwich – fierce Norvalgian warriors gather in their famous debating arenas, pray for strength from their gods and fight. The gods guide Norvalgians by granting victory to the team that champions the cause of truth and justice. \n \nThe most venerated and experienced debaters are eventually named Battlemasters who organize the events and serve as guides and teachers for the young warriors. \n \n“An emissary from Norvalg arrived yesterday. He handed me a stained scabbard and waited for me to draw the heavy sword from it before starting to recite a ceremonial poem with his thundering voice. My sword arm and quick wits were needed, he told me, to settle matters for once and all. That was how I received my first Boreal Blade.” \n \nDebates are the cornerstone of the Norvalgian society, and they are deemed holy. Stories are spun, and songs are sung about the renown arena fighters and their clans. Anyone attempting to evade their debating responsibilities is considered a coward. \n \nSometimes it is deemed wise to ask counsel from non-Norvalgians, especially if the debate at hand involves outsiders. Warriors from outside Norvalg’s borders are invited to partake in the debates by sending them a Boreal Blade sword. Most outsiders consider Norvalgian debating tradition confusing and absurd and rather run and hide than make the perilous journey to the north.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pxx.jpg	\N	\N	2019-08-28	2019-09-12 11:32:55.857744	2019-09-12 11:32:55.857744	1.0	boreal-blade	\N

1182	7291	Hunt: Showdown	Savage, nightmarish monsters roam the Louisiana swamps, and you are part of a group of rugged bounty hunters bound to rid the world of their ghastly presence. Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always. \n \nHunt’s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each match, up to five teams of two set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they’ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don’t watch your back, you’ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of another team of Hunters walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward–but a single mistake could cost you everything. \n \nPROGRESSION: Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. \n \nDARK SIGHT: Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pr1.jpg	\N	\N	2019-08-27	2019-09-12 11:38:56.82033	2019-09-12 11:38:56.82033	10.3604672347469	hunt-showdown	\N

994	2907	Killer Instinct	Killer Instinct is a fighting game developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo. It was released as an arcade game in the fall of 1994 and, the following year, ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and the Game Boy. The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organising a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\n\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced "auto-doubles", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are "combo breakers", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.	Ultratech is a very powerful megacorporation which organises a tournament called Killer Instinct. Along with regular participants, experimental creatures created by Ultratech also fight in the tournament so their strength can be tested. Ultratech also discovers a technology to make bridges between dimensions, and releases a two-headed, one-eyed, satyr monster called Eyedol from this dimensional prison.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/puzpihjejc5dtngpglhf.jpg	\N	\N	1994-10-28	2019-09-01 09:30:05.826688	2019-09-01 09:30:19.551194	1.64979655537595	killer-instinct-4b80e17d-993d-4b64-aa21-161c42ed2639	19

995	2930	Killer Instinct 2	Killer Instinct 2 follows on from the plot line that the previous installment ended with.

Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat, but Chief Thunder, Cinder and Riptor did not return. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qamct56l4sdikeb31gjq.jpg	\N	\N	1996-12-31	2019-09-01 09:30:09.051217	2019-09-01 09:30:19.553766	1.4355223888205	killer-instinct-2	19

1070	24869	Resident Evil	Remake of the 1996 game Resident Evil, the first installment in the Resident Evil video game series. The story takes place in 1998 near the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a series of bizarre murders have taken place. The player takes on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, S.T.A.R.S. agents sent in by the city to investigate the murders. \n \nResident Evil was developed over the course of one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring the game closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics were vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game. \n \nUpon release, Resident Evil received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its graphics and improved gameplay over the original game. It is often described as one of the best, scariest, and most visually impressive entries in the Resident Evil series. Despite this, the game sold worse than expected and led Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action-oriented approach. In 2008, the game was ported to the Wii, featuring a new control system. A high-definition version of the game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in 2015 to positive critical reception and commercial success.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pe8.jpg	\N	\N	2002-03-21	2019-09-04 07:29:08.040438	2019-09-04 07:29:51.488943	3.6744192099277	resident-evil-ed1d8451-da91-488e-8c00-95cfa809933c	21

1004	1613	Mortal Kombat: Deception	Mortal Kombat: Deception is a 3D fighting game developed and published by Midway on October 4, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is the sixth installment in the Mortal Kombat franchise, adding new gameplay mechanics (including a manual " Combo Breaker" system, stage-specific "death traps", and stage-specific weapons), online multiplayer, new mini-games, and a new adventure/fighting hybrid Konquest Mode that serves as the prologue to the events taking place in Mortal Kombat: Deception. The game was later released in March 1, 2005 for the GameCube and November 13, 2006 for the PlayStation Portable (under the title "Mortal Kombat: Unchained"), each with bonus characters from previous Mortal Kombat games. A bonus disc came in collector's editions of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox verions, including video biographies and a port of the original Mortal Kombat. \n \nThe story of Mortal Kombat: Deception takes place right after Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. As the deadly alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung emerge victorious against Raiden's warriors, a new evil, the Dragon King and former emperor of Outworld Onaga, appears to seek the six artifacts (the Kamidogu) that grant him supreme power over all realms. The main protagonist is Shujinko, a warrior with the power to copy other fighter's abilities who was deceived into ressurecting Onaga prior to the main story.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/o89qxythqeswh5fuflir.jpg	\N	\N	2004-10-04	2019-09-01 14:43:46.697835	2019-09-01 14:45:10.560408	1.43216138794441	mortal-kombat-deception	20
1005	1614	Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks	Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is a standalone game in the Mortal Kombat series. Shaolin Monks was developed by Midway LA (formerly Paradox Development) and published by Midway for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and was released September 16, 2005 in the United States. A Nintendo Gamecube,PlayStation Portable Versions Were Planned But it Was Cancelled. A Game Boy Advance And Nintendo DS Versions Were Also Cancelled Because they felt the game was not for kids under seventeen years old. In October 2004, the president of Midway, David F. Zucker, called the release of Shaolin Monks the "first step toward delivering something that Mortal Kombat fans have been calling for: a new game set in the Mortal Kombat universe every year.	The battle raged furiously on Shang Tsung's island fortress in the Lost Sea. While the demon sorcerer watches from his throne, several fights occur. The Shaolin monk Liu Kang defeats Shang Tsung, and the giant Goro comes to his defense. With Goro distracting everyone else, Shang Tsung creates a portal to Outworld and retreats. Raiden appears afterwards and warns the remaining fighters to get off the island palace because it is collapsing into the sea.\n\nEveryone, except Liu Kang and Kung Lao, evacuates and escape back to the Wu Shi Academy. Liu Kang and Kung Lao, however, have to fight their way to another portal to get to Wushi Academy. Upon arrival, they meet Baraka and the Tarkatan attacking the Wu Shi Academy. The Tarkatans are defeated, but Baraka captures Sonya Blade. Raiden confirms that Shang Tsung is trying to lure Liu Kang and his allies to Outworld where he can order his henchmen to attack them and bide his time for power. If successful, Shang Tsung will conquer Earth without winning a Mortal Kombat tournament, which is cheating.\n\nThe Shaolin Monks, Liu Kang and Kung Lao, journey through the nightmarish realm of Outworld to stop the sorcerer's plot. They are guided by Raiden and assisted by Johnny Cage. Throughout their journeys, they are joined by a mysterious princess named Kitana, meet familiar foes and eventually save Sonya and stop Shang Tsung. But the sorcerer is not the only person who wants Earth; the Emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn, wants Earth for his realm and he will stop at nothing until he gets it.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1oxg.jpg	\N	\N	2005-09-16	2019-09-01 14:43:52.0171	2019-09-01 14:45:10.562774	1.86777891733263	mortal-kombat-shaolin-monks	20

1007	1616	Mortal Kombat: Armageddon	Throughout the Mortal Kombat universe, the warriors were growing too strong and numerous for the realms to handle. The warriors' powers threaten to utterly destroy the fabric of the MK universe. Upon this scene, the Elder Gods demanded a safeguard to be put in place to absorb the kombatants' insatiable bloodlust. In an enormous crater in Edenia, these warriors clashed in a single battle royale between the Forces of Light and Darkness that would threaten to rip apart reality and bring about the Apocalypse. Without warning, a mysterious pyramid rises from the ground, and the tip bursts into flames, attracting the warriors' curiosity to see what it was. The kombatants fought one another to get to the top, while Blaze, the gods' firespawn revealed himself to them. The firespawn was created by Delia, a powerful Edenian sorceress, and the mother of the main character in "Konquest" mode to destroy each fighter that would threaten him in order to save the realms from Armageddon. This would be the warriors' last battle, their last chance to prove that they are worthy of surviving, while many others will die.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/la1ybepan97ctppor6dh.jpg	\N	\N	2006-10-11	2019-09-01 14:43:58.983851	2019-09-01 14:45:10.56749	1.43773673938856	mortal-kombat-armageddon	20
1008	1617	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is a crossover fighting video game between Mortal Kombat and the DC Comics fictional universe, developed by Midway Games and Warner Bros. Games. The game was released on November 16, 2008 and contains characters from both franchises. Its story was written by comic writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. Despite being a crossover, the game is considered to be the eighth installment in the main Mortal Kombat series, as confirmed by the naming of the tenth entry by this count: Mortal Kombat X. \n \nThe game takes place after Raiden, Earthrealm's god of Thunder, and Superman, protector of Earth, repel invasions from both their worlds. An attack by both Raiden and Superman simultaneously in their separate universes causes the merging of the Mortal Kombat and DC villains, Shao Kahn and Darkseid, resulting in the creation of Dark Kahn, whose mere existence causes the two universes to begin merging; if allowed to continue, it would result in the destruction of both. Characters from both universes begin to fluctuate in power, becoming stronger or weaker. \n \nMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 and is available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It is the first Mortal Kombat title developed solely for seventh generation video game consoles. Most reviewers agreed that Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was entertaining and made good use of its DC Universe license, but the game's lack of unlockable features as opposed to past installments of Mortal Kombat and toned-down finishing moves garnered some criticism	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/daw8okqezrjswn6960pk.jpg	\N	\N	2008-11-16	2019-09-01 14:44:03.642763	2019-09-01 14:45:10.56975	1.65328358323075	mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe	20
1009	1618	Mortal Kombat	Mortal Kombat is a 1992 Fighting video game by Midway, originally designed for Arcade systems, but later ported to various home computers and consoles. Mortal Kombat was well received around the world and has spawned countless sequels and spin-offs with it's 22nd title coming up in 2015. Mortal Kombat is the first game in the Mortal Kombat series and was followed by Mortal Kombat II in 1993.	Mortal Kombat follows the story of the Mortal Kombat tournament, a sacred martial arts contest created by the Shaolin Monks, that takes place on a secluded island. Over 500 years ago, the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung overthrew the monks with the help of the monster warrior Goro, and now hosts the contest to steal the souls of the contest's losers to keep himself immortal and powerful. This year's Mortal Kombat tournament is about to take place, and 7 contestants are ready to fight. Liu Kang a noble Shaolin warrior, Scorpion and Sub-Zero, two rival ninja warriors with origins shrouded in secrecy, Johnny Cage a professional martial arts movie star, Raiden the God of Thunder, invited by Shang Tsung personally, Kano a ruthless crime lord, and Sonya Blade a US special forces soldier hunting after Kano.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1hno.jpg	\N	\N	1992-08-02	2019-09-01 14:44:06.842715	2019-09-01 14:45:10.572066	2.11434133746987	mortal-kombat-44e9fab5-fab2-4b08-afbb-891c0c93d8bc	20
1010	1619	Mortal Kombat II	500 years ago, Shang Tsung was banished to the Earth Realm. With the aid of Goro he was to unbalance the furies and doom the planet to a chaotic existence. By seizing control of the shaolin tournament he tried to tip the scales of order towards chaos. Only seven warriors survived the battles and Shang Tsung's scheme would come to a violent end at the hands of Liu Kang. Facing execution for his failure and the apparent death of Goro, Tsung convinces Shao Kahn to grant him a second chance.. Shang Tsung's new plan is to lure his enemies to compete in the Outworld where they will meet certain death by Shao Kahn himself. Now, the Kombat continues...\n\nFollowing his defeat to Liu Kang, Shang Tsung begs his master, Shao Kahn, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and restores Tsung's youth. He extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The tournament is dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will unbalance the furies and allow Outworld to subdue Earthrealm.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1iaf.jpg	\N	\N	1993-04-01	2019-09-01 14:44:09.390355	2019-09-01 14:45:10.574417	1.43216138794441	mortal-kombat-ii	20
1011	1620	Mortal Kombat 3	Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) is a fighting game developed by Midway Games and first released into arcades in 1995 as the third game in the Mortal Kombat series. As in the previous games, it has a cast of characters that players choose from and guide through a series of battles against other opponents. The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors, as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn, who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm.\nThe third installment of Mortal Kombat retains the blood and gory attacks that defined the series. It introduces new types of the Fatality finishing moves, including Animalities. Other features new to the series were combos, predefined sequences used to perform a series of consecutive attacks. A "Run" button was also added, allowing players to briefly dash toward the opponent, as were "Kombat Kodes", an unlockable content system using various symbols that can be entered before two-player matches to achieve certain effects.\nSome characters from the previous games returned and new characters were introduced into the series. Mortal Kombat 3 notably omitted popular characters from previous games, some of whom were added in an update, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, released later in 1995. The PC and home console-exclusive Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996) added even more characters, as well as other new features.	Mortal Kombat 3 builds further on the gameplay of the previous game. A "Run" button, accompanied by a "Run" meter, was introduced. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. The Run meter is drained by running (the character cannot run backwards, only forwards) and by performing combos.\n"Chain combos", also known as pre-programmed combos (labeled "dial-a-combos") were also introduced. Chain combos are button sequences that cannot be interrupted once one hit connects; some chain combos end with an uppercut or other move that knocks the opponent into the air, so that more damage can be dealt via a traditional juggle combo. To please players of various skill levels, a "Choose Your Destiny" screen appears in the single player mode to allow player-selectable difficulty.\nFor the first time, certain levels were interactive by allowing characters to uppercut each other through the ceiling where both characters would continue the battle in a different stage. This could alter the game's level cycle. Both normal uppercuts and uppercuts that are part of a ground combo would result in a level change. Kung Lao's "Whirl Wind Spin" move would also have the same effect. However, if the character is defeated by an uppercut, there is no level change.\nAll of the different styles of finishing moves featured in Mortal Kombat II (Fatalities, including the non-lethal Babality and Friendship moves) return in MK3. Additionally, the rumored Animality, where the character transforms into an animal in order to kill their opponent, is featured for the first time. Another new addition is the Mercy, where the character can give their opponent a small sliver of life if they have won two rounds and are at the "Finish Him/Her" screen. A Mercy is necessary for an Animality to occur. Finally, three new Stage Fatalities can be performed in the Subway, the Bell Tower and the Pit 3.\nAnother concept introduced in this game is the "Kombat Kode". A Kombat Kode is a six-symbol code entered at the VS screen in a two-player game to modify gameplay, fight hidden characters or display certain text messages. Also introduced in this game was the "Ultimate Kombat Kode", a 10-character code using symbols, that could be entered on the game over screen after the continue screen disappears in single player mode. It was used to unlock a robotic version of the character Smoke; it can be done by either the player or the arcade operator. The arcade owner could reset this code by accessing the game's diagnostic menu by toggling a DIP switch within the MK3 cabinet. The codes were revealed through gaming magazines, promotional material and other Mortal Kombat media.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ekf2wwvzogrgig5qpxkr.jpg	\N	\N	1995-04-15	2019-09-01 14:44:20.206148	2019-09-01 14:45:10.576756	3.89728747742167	mortal-kombat-3	20
1013	1622	Mortal Kombat 4	Mortal Kombat 4 is the fourth installment of one of the most violent fighting game franchises of all time, moving the series to 3D while introducing limited weapon-based combat.	Thousands of years before the setting of the first game, Shinnok, one of the Elder Gods who control the six realms in the Mortal Kombat universe, attempted to become the conqueror of them all. Thunder god Raiden fought and defeated Shinnok in a war that spanned hundreds of years, sending him to the Netherrealm, where he would be trapped forever. Now, Shinnok has managed to escape from the Netherealm with help from the sorcerer Quan Chi, and seeks vengeance against the Elder Gods who banished him. In his plan, he first conquers the realm of Edenia, with the aid of a traitor, Tanya, while he prepares to attack the Elder Gods. In order to stop Shinnok's menace, Raiden requests help from the Earthrealm warriors who saved the realms from Emperor Shao Kahn in previous titles.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/odhstgsvruzkoiaafiwq.jpg	\N	\N	1997-10-15	2019-09-01 14:44:24.572187	2019-09-01 14:45:10.581436	1.86639540716794	mortal-kombat-4	20
1015	2977	Mortal Kombat : Komplete Edition	Raiden is about to be killed by Shao Kahn, and just before he delivers the last blow, Raiden sends a mental message to his earlier self by saying that he must win, and the camera rewinds back to Mortal Kombat 1. The Raiden from Mortal Kombat 1 then gets the message and experiences a premonition. The game then spans Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3, retelling the story with an enlightened Raiden, who has changed the course of events. Eventually, everything the player has seen happen before — Liu Kang winning, Lin Kuei turning into cybernetic ninjas, has been altered. You might see a cybernetic character who wasn't before, and a different version of events.	Following the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, both the forces of light and darkness have been wiped out, with only the thunder god Raiden and Shao Kahn remaining to represent their parties. A severely weakened Raiden is about to be killed by Shao Kahn, but casts a last-minute spell on his now-shattered magical amulet, directing it to contact his past self with the vague message "He must win". \nDuring the events of the first tournament hosted by Shang Tsung, the past version of Raiden sees visions of the future courtesy of a now cracked amulet. Raiden initially comes to the conclusion that fighter Liu Kang is to win the tournament and save Earthrealm from Outworld. Pivotal characters such as Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, Jax Briggs, Sektor, Cyrax, Nightwolf, Kitana, Jade, and Sub-Zero are introduced, the latter being murdered by the hellspawn Scorpion. In time, Liu Kang remains the only Earthrealm champion, and succeeds in defeating Shang Tsung and the Shokan Prince Goro. However, Raiden's amulet continues to deteriorate, a sign that future events remain unchanged. Disappointed with Shang Tsung's failure, Shao Kahn orders his execution, but relents when the sorcerer suggests holding the second tournament in Outworld. Raiden initially refuses, but is forced to relent when Shang Tsung threatens to unleash Outworld's armies upon Earthrealm.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qscrhgzffnyblbskedqk.jpg	\N	\N	2011-04-19	2019-09-01 14:44:35.619971	2019-09-01 14:45:10.586018	2.51996641188066	mortal-kombat-komplete-edition	20

Further versions were also released for the Game.com and R-Zone.\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy features the same gameplay and story as Mortal Kombat 3, but adds characters and stages from the other three arcade games, including Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Some completely new characters were also introduced. New additions to the game included the "Aggressor" bar, a meter that fills during the course of the match and temporarily makes a player character faster and stronger. It also features the Brutality, a long combination of attacks that ends with the opponent exploding.\n\nThe game was met with mixed reviews, with the harshest criticism directed at the Nintendo 64 version, which did not have all the content of the other versions due to limited storage space on the cartridge.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cibj4ovdfn0oacqzqwhj.jpg	\N	\N	1996-09-01	2019-09-01 14:44:37.477569	2019-09-01 14:45:10.588301	2.11434133746987	mortal-kombat-trilogy	20

The game is said to include a new, original and non-linear storyline "showcasing some of the game's most prolific characters including Scorpion and Sub-Zero, while introducing new challengers that represent the forces of good and evil and tie the tale together." At E3 2014, it was confirmed that the story would begin at the end of the previous game and then eventually transition to twenty-five years into the future, placing emphasis on aged veterans, new characters and the next-generation offspring of the previous fighters.\n\nCharacters\nAlong with incumbents Scorpion and Sub-Zero, four new fighters have been announced so far: D'Vorah, a woman who controls insects; Ferra/Torr, a pairing consisting of a dwarf-woman and a giant masked brute; Cassie Cage, the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade; and Kotal Kahn, an Aztec-inspired "blood god." According to series creator Ed Boon, the game's main antagonist will be a "surprise returning character." Each character will come in three very different versions. For example, Scorpion's three variations are "Hellfire", "Ninjutsu" and "Inferno".	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1i7u.jpg	\N	\N	2015-04-07	2019-09-01 14:44:41.450373	2019-09-01 14:45:10.590614	5.90310188486744	mortal-kombat-x	20

1030	424	Resident Evil	Resident Evil is a survival horror classic in which a group of special forces agents, known as S.T.A.R.S, struggle against hordes of zombies and various other mutants in a mysterious mansion as they try to uncover the truth behind the terrifying infection. The game is credited for coining the phrase "survival horror" and popularizing the genre.	In July 24, 1998, when a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the Midwestern town of Raccoon City, the Raccoon City Police Department's S.T.A.R.S. team are assigned to investigate. After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. \n \nDepending on which character the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry are separated from the rest of the team during the chase and do not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character may encounter several members of Bravo Team, including Enrico Marini, the captain of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus. \n \nEventually, the player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player encounters Wesker, who reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier, to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction, at which point the player may be confronted by Tyrant one last time. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points over the course of the game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter as the mansion self-destructs. In contrast, in the worst possible ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lha9yqysht3ufkgzepcz.jpg	\N	\N	1996-03-22	2019-09-04 07:20:21.224799	2019-09-04 07:29:51.387313	3.89728747742167	resident-evil	21

It takes place in 2002 and is set in the waterside village of Mixcoatl, located in the South American Amparo. It tells the story of Leon S.

763	4118	Spider-Man 2 : Enter Electro	Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro is an action-adventure video game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Activision for the PlayStation in 2001. It is the sequel to Neversoft's Spider-Man title, which was released the previous year. The game follows Spider-Man as he attempts to stop another old nemesis Electro from obtaining a source of power known as the Bio-Nexus Device. Game bosses include Shocker, Hammerhead, Lizard, Sandman and the exclusive charged-up Hyper-Electro.	Shortly after the Symbiote Invasion, a series of robberies led by Electro have taken place throughout New York City. While out on patrol, Spider-Man spots one of the robberies taking place at a building owned by BioTech. Planting a Spider-Tracer on the head thief's motorcycle, Spider-Man follows it to an abandoned warehouse where the thief is passing off a stolen briefcase to a contact. Spider-Man takes out the thugs and interrogates one of them, but is then attacked by the head thief: Shocker.\n\nAfter defeating Shocker, Spider-Man follows the thug's tip and heads for the airfield, where the contact is heading towards. Along the way, Spider-Man is forced to disable a bomb threat, take out a machine-gun nest, and stop a runaway airplane from crashing. As the contact escapes via helicopter, Spider-Man is able to plant another tracer on it and track it to a trainyard owned by Hammerhead. Fighting through the mob-employed night staff and Sandman, Spider-Man races to catch a fleeing train and meets with the contact, who is revealed as The Beetle. The masked villain escapes with his briefcase, but he unknowingly leaves Spider-Man a clue: an invitation to the Science and Industry Ball.\n\nElsewhere, Electro explains his plan to the other villains. He and his partners have stolen the parts to the Bio-Nexus Device, which can amplify one's bio-energy to power a city block, and Electro plans to use it to increase his own powers. The device is currently incomplete, and only its creator Dr. Watts knows how to finish it. Hammerhead and his goons are sent to the Science and Industry Ball to take Dr. Watts hostage.\n\nThough Spider-Man arrives at the Ball and manages to defeat Hammerhead, Sandman secretly escapes with the good doctor. Spider-Man decides to call Dr. Curt Conners at BioTech for some answers, but hears the sounds of a battle on the line. Spider-Man immediately infiltrates BioTech and reaches Dr. Connors's lab, where his alter-ego The Lizard is on an uncontrolled rampage. After being changed back to normal, Conners explains Electro's goal to become a god with the Bio-Nexus Device. He instructs Spider-Man to go and check out Dr. Watts' lab. Following a rooftop chase, Spider-Man eventually arrives at the lab and learns of the device's main power source, only to be caught in another battle with Sandman. After defeating Sandman by flushing him down the sewer grate with water, Spider-Man subsequently sees a newspaper article about the power source - a sapphire named Zeus's Tear - being on display at the museum. Electro is also informed of the jewel when one of his thugs brings him the same news article.\n\nAt the museum, Spider-Man catches up to Electro, who is still holding Dr. Watts as his hostage. He offers to give her up if Spider-Man gives him the Zeus's Tear. Spider-Man reluctantly obeys, and Electro tosses the doctor as Spider-Man throws the jewel. When Spider-Man attempts to snag the jewel back in midair with a web, Dr. Watts accidentally throws off his aim and he misses, allowing Electro to catch it. The Bio-Nexus Device complete, Electro activates it and flies off in an electrifying flash of lightning bolt. Spider-Man follows the villain to a massive conductor at a tower, where he supercharges himself into Hyper-Electro, a being of pure electrical energy. Unable to directly attack Electro, Spider-Man instead uses the tower's generators to overload and destroy the Bio-Nexus Device, ending Electro's power play for good.\n\nThe next day, The Mighty Thor is credited in the Daily Bugle as having saved New York from Electro, much to Spider-Man's disappointment. In prison, Electro sits in his cell moaning over his defeat while Hammerhead and Shocker play Poker.

833	3	Thief: Deadly Shadows	In the third instalment of the Thief series, master-thief Garrett is contacted by Keeper Artemus with a mission to steal two valuable artefacts. At the same time, Garrett learns about a prophecy: the coming of a Dark Age. He embarks upon a journey to unravel a mystery that threatens the existence of the order of Keepers. Is it possible that there is a traitor in their midst? \n \nThe stealth and thievery game, Thief: Deadly Shadows comes with a number of improvements over two previous parts. Released in 2004, it left behind the aging Dark Engine, using a heavily modified Unreal engine instead. Realistic lighting effects have been implemented: each character and object now casts its own shadow. A third person's view has been made available in addition to the standard first person perspective. \n \nThe stealth system that made Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2: The Metal Age famous is still in place. You have to stick to the shadows and avoid making noise, as guards will react to anything suspicious. It is also the first game of the series that introduced free roaming. The City, divided into several unlockable districts, is yours to explore. You can interact with the city's inhabitants: pickpocket, steal, or even mug them for loot.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ug5wnn7lfr0tts3wnkuj.jpg	\N	\N	2004-05-25	2019-08-20 09:29:18.937334	2019-08-20 09:29:18.937334	2.76277418438618	thief-deadly-shadows	\N

834	740	Halo: Combat Evolved	Bent on Humankind's extermination, a powerful fellowship of alien races known as the Covenant is wiping out Earth's fledgling interstellar empire. Climb into the boots of Master Chief, a biologically altered super-soldier, as you and the other surviving defenders of a devastated colony-world make a desperate attempt to lure the alien fleet away from earth. Shot down and marooned on the ancient ring-world Halo, you begin a guerilla-war against the Covenant. Fight for humanity against an alien onslaught as you race to uncover the mysteries of Halo.	After the fall of Reach, The Pillar of Autumn, the only surviving human ship, makes a random slip-space jump away from the planet, so as not to lead the Covenant to Earth. When the Autumn drops out of slip-space, they find themselves next to a large, artificial, ring-world. A Covenant fleet hiding behind the adjacent planet engages the Autumn, the biologically augmented super-soldier John 117, or the Master Chief, is taken out of cryostasis. He proceeds to the bridge while fighting hordes of boarding Covenant forces. The Master Chief retrieves the ship-board AI (Artificial Intelligence) Cortana from the Captain of the vessel, Captain Keyes. The Chief and Cortana board an escape craft and begin to drop towards the surface of the ring-world. The Chief is the only one in his escape pod to survive the impact, and sneaks away from the crash site.

836	987	Halo 3	Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the "Golden Triangle of Halo": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back. \nHalo 3 introduces "support weapons", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.	After the events of the comic tie-in Halo: Uprising, the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief, Johnson, and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld. \nTraveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard High Charity in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth. The Arbiter, Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter. \nThe Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from High Charity and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect "his" ring. The Chief destroys Guilty Spark, activates the ring, and escapes the ring's self-destruction on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. However, the force of Halo's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of Forward Unto Dawn, carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth. \nA memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet, Sanghelios. Meanwhile, the rear half of the Forward Unto Dawn drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. The Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana to "wake me, when you need me." If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of Forward Unto Dawn drifting towards an unknown planet, revealed in the sequel to be known as "Requiem", the primary setting of the campaign of Halo 4.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kzmuokcdleegufex1ikh.jpg	\N	\N	2007-09-25	2019-08-20 10:32:48.227206	2019-08-20 10:33:48.375205	4.77714793327932	halo-3	11

840	2640	Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary	Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is a spectacular remastered version of the original game, created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of one of the most beloved first-person shooters in gaming history. Bundled with seven of the most popular multiplayer maps in Halo history ready for Xbox Live, Halo: Anniversary includes a bounty of new features including cooperative play over Xbox Live, Achievements, new challenges, and new fiction to uncover.	The game opens just following the events of Halo: Reach, as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace near a mysterious ring-shaped space station, called "Halo" by the enemy in the game, the Covenant. A Covenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn. Captain Keyes initiates "The Cole Protocol, "a procedure which destroys all navigation data and is designed to prevent the Covenant from learning the location of Earth. Master Chief and Cortana fight their way to an escape pod, where they eject from the ship along with a group of Marines. As they fly away they can see Keyes attempting to crash land Pillar on Halo. \n \nMaster Chief and Cortana are the only survivors of their pod's crash landing, but they soon contact other survivors and help collect them into a fighting force. The survivors tell them that Keyes survived the Pillar of Autumn's crash landing, but has been captured by the Covenant and is being held aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Master Chief and a force of Marines board the ship and rescue Keyes, who orders Master Chief to beat the Covenant to Halo's control center and to discover Halo's purpose. Master Chief and Cortana travel to a map room called the Silent Cartographer, which leads them to the control room. There, Cortana enters the systems and, discovering something urgent, suddenly sends Master Chief to find Captain Keyes while she stays behind. Keyes was searching for what he believed was a cache of powerful weapons, but when he reaches his position Master Chief finds only signs of a battle and a recording revealing they have accidentally released the Flood, a parasitic alien race capable of spreading itself by infesting other sentient life-forms. \n \nThe release of the Flood prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to recruit Master Chief in retrieving the Index, a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from spreading beyond the facility. After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies the Flood requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms. \n \nFaced with this information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While fighting the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers that the best way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumn's fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just getting started. \n \nIn a brief post-credits scene, 343 Guilty Spark is seen fleeing Halo's destruction and into the unknown of deep space.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1hum.jpg	\N	\N	2011-11-15	2019-08-20 10:33:00.641619	2019-08-20 10:33:48.381051	1.88874069018337	halo-combat-evolved-anniversary	11

881	427	Final Fantasy VII	Set in a dystopian world, Final Fantasy VII's story centers on mercenary Cloud Strife who joins with several others to stop the megacorporation Shinra, which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, the situation escalates and Cloud and his allies face Sephiroth, the game's main antagonist.	The game begins with Cloud Strife, working as a mercenary for hire, helping the eco terrorist group AVALANCHE in a raid against the Mako reactors surrounding the Shinra-governed city of Midgar. Barret, the group's leader, believes the Mako energy the reactors consume to be the planet's lifeblood, and Shinra's reactors are killing the planet. Cloud's childhood friend, Tifa, is also in the group. Although the first mission is successful, AVALANCHE is ambushed at the next reactor during a subsequent raid. When the reactor explodes, Cloud drops down into Midgar's slums. He is found by Aerith (aka Aeris), a girl he briefly met selling flowers after his first mission with AVALANCHE. Prompted by the arrival of the Turks, who have been sent to capture Aerith, Cloud agrees to act as her bodyguard and defends her from their assault. Meanwhile, Shinra learns the location of AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7, and subsequently destroys it by dropping the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums, killing its population. The Turks also capture Aerith, who is revealed to be the last surviving "Cetra", an ancient near-dead tribe closely attuned with the planet. President Shinra and Professor Hojo believe Aerith is the key to finding the "Promised Land", a mythical land of fertility they see as an abundant source of Mako. The remaining AVALANCHE members - Cloud, Barret and Tifa - infiltrate Shinra to rescue Aerith, in the process encountering a specimen simply labeled "Jenova". Joined by Red XIII, a sentient tiger-like creature on whom Hojo had been conducting experiments, the party rescues Aerith, but is captured by the Turks while trying to escape and detained within the building. In the morning, they find their cells open and most of the personnel, including President Shinra, killed: the perpetrator appears to be Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER leader who was presumed dead several years ago.The group discovers that the Jenova specimen is also missing, presumed stolen by Sephiroth. \n \nWhile the president's son, Rufus Shinra, assumes control of the company, the party leaves Midgar and pursues Sephiroth across the planet. They are joined by Cait Sith, a cat-robot secretly controlled by repentant Turk Reeve Tuesti; Yuffie Kisaragi, a teenage ninja from Wutai; Vincent Valentine, a former Turk; and Cid Highwind, a chain-smoking pilot. At a Cetra temple, the party encounters Sephiroth, who reveals his plan: if the world is significantly damaged, the Lifestream, made of pure Mako energy, will gather in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use the legendary Black Materia to cast a spell called "Meteor" to cause a massive injury, enabling him to merge with the planet's Mako energy and be reborn as a god. The party drives off Sephiroth, acquiring the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into giving him the Materia. While the party recovers from the encounter, Aerith sets off to stop Sephiroth on her own, following him to an ancient Cetra city. The party follows, and finds Aerith praying to the planet for aid. Just as they reach her, Sephiroth kills her. Cloud and his allies track Sephiroth to the North Crater. During their journey, they find out that Jenova is an interstellar creature who crashed on the planet roughly two thousand years ago, intent on taking over completely. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called Weapons. While most humans fled, the Cetra managed to defeat Jenova and entomb its remains. A few decades before the present, the remains of Jenova were unearthed by Professor Gast, a researcher for Shinra. Mistaking Jenova for a Cetra, Gast attempted to clone Jenova, assisted by Hojo. Even though Gast abandoned the project, Hojo successfully managed to use his assistant's unborn child for the experiment: the baby was Sephiroth. Approximately five years before the present day, while on a Shinra mission with Cloud to Cloud's and Tifa's hometown of Nibelheim, Sephiroth encountered Hojo's failed test subjects and learned of his origins. Mistakenly believing that Jenova and he were Cetra, he was driven insane and destroyed Nibelheim as an act of vengeance on the normal human population. Cloud and Tifa confronted Sephiroth during the massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished, presumed dead until his reappearance in the present day. \n \nWhen the party reaches the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth for killing Aerith, they learn that Sephiroth was one of multiple Jenova clones that Hojo had created from both animals and humans. Upon reaching Sephiroth, who has been killing and absorbing the Jenova clones to instigate a "Reunion" of Jenova's cells, he manipulates Cloud into helping him cast Meteor, then states that Cloud is one of Sephiroth's clones, showing him memories of the Nibelheim incident with a black-haired SOLDIER in Cloud's place. The summoning of Meteor activates the planet's Weapons, and during the subsequent earthquake, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream. The rest of the party and the Turks that had followed them to the Crater escape on the airship, the Highwind, where the party members are placed under arrest. As Meteor approaches the planet, the Weapons turn on humanity in an attempt to return as much Mako energy to the Lifestream as possible to aid the planet. Shinra focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the Weapons and attempting to destroy Meteor directly, which eventually costs the lives of the majority of Shinra's personnel.[31] Tifa, Barret and the others are sentenced to be executed, but escape. They find a catatonic Cloud at a hospital in a tropical resort, where he washed up following the events at the North Crater. Tifa stays behind to help Cloud recover, while the rest of the party continue their fight against Shinra. An attack by the Weapons destroys the island, and Cloud and Tifa both fall into the Lifestream. There, Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories and learns the truth about his past. \n \nIt is revealed that Cloud was not accepted into SOLDIER, and that the SOLDIER in Sephiroth's visions was Aerith's first love and Cloud's friend, Zack Fair. The two were present during the Nibelheim incident, with Cloud managing to fatally wound Sephiroth, who only survived through Jenova's cells: Zack and Cloud were severely wounded and later taken and used by Hojo to perfect his SOLDIER and Jenova experiments. Zack tried escaping with Cloud but was killed by Shinra soldiers. Cloud recovered, took Zack's sword and made his way to Midgar: Cloud's own aspirations to SOLDIER and Zack's memories and stories combined, with the help of the Jenova treatment, to create a false personality. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud is able to recover. After Cloud and Tifa emerge from the Lifestream, the party regroup and learn that Aerith, in her final moments, was attempting to use the White Materia to cast the spell "Holy", the only means of opposing Meteor. It turns out she was successful in casting the spell, but Sephiroth has been preventing its release. The group decide to first stop the rampage of the Weapons. Alongside this, the party confront Hojo, revealed to be Sephiroth's father, as the scientist attempts to aid his son by feeding Mako energy to him. After mutating himself with Jenova cells, he is killed in combat. After this, they launch their final assault on Sephiroth, who is defeated by Cloud after a series of battles. The party escapes from the crater as Holy is released. Holy attempts to block Meteor under Midgar, but Meteor has drawn too close for Holy to combat it alone. Just before Meteor's impact, the Lifestream rises from the planet to aid Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/idzdf1alxvetz3ow2ugy.jpg	\N	\N	1997-01-31	2019-08-22 09:34:14.209498	2019-08-22 09:38:31.063327	17.2075710345712	final-fantasy-vii	13

"2013 was the first year we spotted them. We had no way of knowing what they were back then; just blips and warbles on the scanners, far out in space, slowly heading our way. Some of us hoped they were elder beings, coming to share their wisdom or take us to a better place. We all hoped that, really, but some of us had the foresight to plan for other possibilities, and that's how Earth Defense Force was born. \n \nIt took four years to corral the world's militaries into assembling and equipping a joint task force. By the time all the petty politics were out of the way, we scarcely had time to train the troops. Not knowing what to expect, we ran EDF through every sci-fi scenario we could imagine. \n \nThen, in 2017, they arrived. And they opened fire. Not just from the sky, with their starships and battle machines, but from underneath the ground as well, with swarms and swarms of giant mutant insects. We called the aliens Ravagers, and across the globe, they lived up to that name. Only EDF, with their specialized weapons and training, stood a chance. Finally, after the bloodiest war in history, EDF blasted the last Ravager off the planet. \n \nWe thought that was the end of it. It had to be. But now, eight short years later, humanity's worst nightmare has come true: What we'd faced had only been the first wave. The Ravagers are back, with new enhanced creatures and machines. Fortunately, EDF has stayed vigilant all this time, and they've put those eight years to good use. With new weapons, new units, and even giants of our own, humanity is ready to go another round, and by the time we're done, they'll never want to come back again."	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1nq8.jpg	\N	\N	2015-04-02	2019-08-28 06:18:05.073045	2019-08-28 06:18:13.952714	3.8157850732958	earth-defense-force-4-1-the-shadow-of-new-despair	16

1056	20456	Resident Evil: Deadly Silence	Resident Evil: Deadly Silence is an enhanced version of the original Resident Evil for the Nintendo DS port. It was made to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series. Toshiaki Mori provided promotional artwork during the release of the game, including cover art.\n\nDeadly Silence includes a "Classic Mode", the original game with minimal enhancements and touch-screen support, and a "Rebirth Mode", containing a greater number of enemies and a series of new puzzles that make use of the platform's specifications.\n\nThe game makes use of the dual screen display with the top screen used to display the map, along with the player's remaining ammunition and health (determined by the color of the background); while the bottom screen displays the main action, and can be switched to show the player's inventory. The DS version also includes updated play mechanics: the 180-degree turn introduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, along with the knife button and tactical reload from Resident Evil 4. The updated controls are applicable to both Classic and Rebirth modes. Dialog and loading screens can now be skipped. The live-action footage was still censored, even in the game's Japanese release; however, the scene showing Kenneth's decapitated head was kept.\n\nIn "Rebirth", new puzzles are added that use the system's touch-screen. "Knife Battle" sequences, viewed from a first-person perspective, are also added, in which the player must fend off incoming enemies by swinging the knife via the stylus. One particular puzzle requires the player to resuscitate an injured comrade by blowing into the built-in microphone. The player can also shake off enemies by using the touch screen, performing a melee attack.\n\nThe game also includes wireless LAN support for up to four players with two different multiplayer game modes. The first is a cooperative mode in which each player must help each other solve puzzles and escape the mansion together. The other is a competitive mode in which the objective is to get the highest score out of all the players by destroying the most monsters, with the tougher monsters being worth more points. There are three playable multiplayer stages and nine playable characters.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ihgibkv6jmsexatrzvxo.jpg	\N	\N	2006-01-19	2019-09-04 07:28:42.992271	2019-09-04 07:29:51.452723	1.0	resident-evil-deadly-silence	21
1057	20622	Resident Evil: Code Veronica X HD	Resident Evil CODE: Veronica (BIOHAZARD CODE: Veronica in Japan) is the fourth game in Capcom's Resident Evil survival horror series originally released for the Sega Dreamcast in 2000. The game takes place on December 27, 1998, three months after the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. It is the first Resident Evil game made for a sixth generation console and the first game to use full polygonal environments instead of the static, pre-rendered backgrounds that characterized the previous installments. \n \nSource: http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_CODE:Veronica	It has been three months since the total destruction of Raccoon City, and Claire Redfield is still searching for her missing brother, Chris. Claire's search takes her to an Umbrella owned facility in Paris where she is discovered and met with fierce resistance. Claire attempts an impressive escape from the clutches of the hired soldiers, but it proves to be just not enough. \n \nShe is captured by Rodrigo Juan Raval, an Umbrella military commander and is shipped to the remote Rockfort Island facility. Claire finds herself interrogated and then imprisoned. She is knocked unconscious by a guard and hours later she awakens to the sound of explosions. \n \nFacing imminent death, Claire receives opportunity once more when an inexplicable air raid on the island wipes out most of the island inhabitants and damages the majority of its structures. Unfortunately, the air raid also causes the accidental release of t-virus samples and B.O.W.s, which spread quickly and wipe out the remaining survivors. \n \nClaire has thrust back into the world of survival horror once again, with the odds seemingly stacked against her. Claire finds support in fellow inmate Steve Burnside but encounters untold hardships when the insane island commander, Alfred Ashford, and his equally evil twin sister, Alexia Ashford, set their sights on causing the end of the duo in their own sick, twisted, and demented games. \n \nClaire and Steve managed to escape the island, only to have been forcibly directed to Antarctica. When attempting to escape the Antarctic Umbrella base, Steve manages to mortally wound Alfred while Claire successfully dispatches a mutated Alexander Ashford. As Claire and Steve attempt to leave for an Australian research outpost in a snowmobile, Claire and Steve get attacked by tentacles deployed by a revived Alexia. \n \nMeanwhile, Chris Redfield has been in hiding with the surviving S.T.A.R.S. members following their harrowing survival story at the Spencer Mansion in Raccoon City. When the word from Leon S. Kennedy reaches him that his sister Claire has been captured by Umbrella, he races against time to reach Rockford and rescue her from danger. However, what Chris discovers on the island is something he never expected - a man from his past who should, by all rights, be dead - his former Captain, Albert Wesker. \n \nWesker has his own agenda that he is relentlessly executing - he is working for a new enemy, pursuing an unknown interest. As Chris soon finds out, this is not the Wesker he remembers, as Wesker possessed super-human speed and strength. Chris learns from Wesker that Claire was already in Antarctica and attempts to rescue her. \n \nChris gets reunited with Claire, with the pair attempting to rescue Steve, only to get separated again. Claire manages to reach Steve, only for him to die a heroic death after saving her from a tentacle. Chris, on the other hand, gets into a skirmish with Alexia and arms the self-destruct system to regroup with Claire. Chris successfully kills Alexia with a prototype weapon and successfully evacuates the base with Claire. \n \nSource: http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_CODE:Veronica/plot	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xulslhjw6yyovhlkigtg.jpg	\N	\N	2011-09-27	2019-09-04 07:28:44.682392	2019-09-04 07:29:51.455104	1.0	resident-evil-code-veronica-x-hd	21

So players can start a DLC tape and not be sure where they even are – and of course, it means the player can die at the end”.	\N	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1lhi.jpg	\N	\N	2017-02-14	2019-09-04 07:29:13.551879	2019-09-04 07:29:51.493854	1.0	resident-evil-7-biohazard-banned-footage-vol-2	21
