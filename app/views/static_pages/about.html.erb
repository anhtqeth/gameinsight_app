    <h1>Sample App</h1>
    <p>
  The gamedb project is created purely on passion of a gaming enthusiastic   
  In our country, there was no thing like this before.
  During my little project at <a href="https://ethugamer.com">Enthusiastic Gamer</a>
  I found IGDB, a huge database services that provide information of the gaming world. 
  Leverage their API, I created this one.
